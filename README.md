# deeplx-balance-server

## Motivation

Since Deeplx calls are subject to request frequency limits (e.g., the common 429 error), I deployed multiple Deeplx services on various Pass platforms. This aggregates multiple APIs so that I only need to call one API endpoint.

## PaaS

I currently have Deeplx deployed on the following platforms and continue to add more.

- [Koyeb](https://www.koyeb.com/)
- [Fl0](https://www.fl0.com/)
- [Ampt](https://ampt.dev/)
